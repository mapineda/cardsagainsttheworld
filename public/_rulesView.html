			<p>It was late 2015 and the tech industry was booming! Jobs were abound, the only problem was no one was getting hired. Where were candidates falling off? The behavioral interview? The technical interview? What began on paper as flashcards to study for technical interviews made its way towards the digital. Now students can turn into master ninja-jedi-rockstar devs by testing their wits against the Cards.	I made this project as an outlet for my frustration during the developer hiring process. I hope this mobile-first, responsive resource helps you get hired as a junior developer coming out of a developer bootcamp.<p>
